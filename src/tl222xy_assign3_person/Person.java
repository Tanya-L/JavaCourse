/**
 * Define a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
 * Define two other classes Faculty and Staff and make them subclasses of the Employee.
 * A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address.
 * A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior).
 * An employee has a salary, and date hired.
 * A faculty member has office hours and a rank.
 * A staff member has a title.
 * Override the toString method in each class so that the method returns a String
 * that contains a personâ€™s complete information.
 * For example, if we invoke toString method on an object of type Faculty,
 * it should return a String containing name, address, phone number, email address,
 * salary, date hired, office hours and rank information.
