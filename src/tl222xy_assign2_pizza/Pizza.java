/**
* This class stores information about a single pizza and is required to contain the following:
*  • private instance variables to store o size of a pizza (either small, medium, or large),
* o number of cheese toppings, o number of pepperoni toppings, o number of ham toppings.
* public methods to get and set all the instance variables.
* a public method named calcCost( ) that returns cost of the pizza.
* Pizza cost is determined as follows:
* Small: 10 kr + 3 kr per topping
* Medium: 15 kr + 2.5 kr per topping
* Large: 20 kr + 2 kr per topping

* A public method named getDescription() that returns a String containing the pizza size,
* type and quantity of selected topping, and the pizza cost, for example as follows:
* “You ordered a Large pizza with 2 pepperoni toppings. Your bill is 24.00 kr”.

* Write another class PizzaMain.java that defines a main method.
* The main method asks a user to order a pizza and displays description of
* the ordered pizza with bill to pay. While ordering a pizza, a user can choose
* only one type of topping (cheese, pepperoni, or ham), however, the chosen
* topping can be ordered in multiple amount, i.e., more than one toppings of same
* type can be ordered. The Pizza class and its methods should be used to handle
* the pizza order and print the order information.
* Executing the PizzaMain.java shall result in following user interaction:
* Sun Jun 23 17:26:55 CEST 2019 Welcome to the Café LNU!
* Please enter size of your pizza [small, medium, or large]: LaRge
* Please enter type of topping [cheese, pepperoni, ham]: pepperoni
* Please enter number of toppings you want: 2
* Thank you, “You ordered a Large pizza with 2 pepperoni toppings.
* Your bill is 24.00 kr”. Enjoy the food!

* Note: • Current Date and Time shall be displayed at top of the console output as shown above.
* Your program must be able to handle pizza size and topping input in any letter case
* (lower, UPPER or miXeD) as shown in the above execution sample.
