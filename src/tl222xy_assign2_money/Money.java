 * amounts of U.S. money. The class shall have:
 * - Two instance variables of type int for the dollars and cents in the amount of money.
 * - A constructor with two parameters of type int for the dollars and cents,
 * - Another constructor with one parameter of type int for an amount of dollars. It should set cents to zero
 * - A no-argument constructor.
 * - Methods add and minus for addition and subtraction of amounts of money,
 * respectively. Both these methods should be static methods, each should have two
 * parameters of type Money, and return a value of type Money.
 * - A set of accessor and mutator methods to get and set values of the two instance
 * variables.
