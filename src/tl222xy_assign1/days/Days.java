        // Write a program Days.java that prompts user to enter two non-negative integer values:
        //! The first value is for today’s day of the week and must be from 0 to 6, for today’s day of the
        //week. The program should display an appropriate error message if the entered value is not
        //from 0 to 6.
        //! The second value is to compute the future day. The future day is computed by adding the
        //second value to the first value.
        //! The program should then determine and print today’s day of the week and the future day of
        //the week based on codes as follows: Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, …, and Saturday is 6.
        //Below are the outputs from two example executions of the program:
        //Run 1:
        //Enter today's day: 1
        //Enter the number for the future day: 3
        //Today is Monday and the future day is Thursday
        //Run 2:
        //Enter today's day: 0
        //Enter the number for the future day: 31
        //Today is Sunday and the future day is Wednesday
