// The Babylonian algorithm to compute square root of a positive number n is as follows:
//1. Make a guess at the answer (you can pick n/2 as your initial guess).
//2. Compute r = n / guess.
//3. Set guess = (guess + r) / 2.
//4. Go back to step 2 until the last two guess values are within 1% of each other.
//Write a program SquareRoot.java that prompts user to enter an integer value for n, iterates
//through the Babylonian algorithm until the guess is within 1% of the previous guess and outputs
//the answer as a real number to two decimal places.
//Page 4 (4)
//Below is an example of the program execution:
//This program estimate square roots.
//Enter an integer to estimate the square root of: 25
//Current guess: 7.25
//Current guess: 5.349137931034482
//Current guess: 5.011394106532552
//Current guess: 5.000012953048684
//The estimated square root of 25 is 5.00
